*Note: This text is a stub only, I am running out of time, hence I could not repeat the computations together with gfenerating HTML output. Sorry.*

Alter loading the data using read.csv(), it appears a 
column named "X" which is simply index of the row. Hence I removed it and also 
the first real column containing user_name.
```
library(caret)
training = read.csv("pml-training.csv")
training = training[c(-1,-2)]

testing = read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
testing = testing[c(-1,-2)]
```

The main problem with the data were undefined values NA and empty values. They 
can be removed

```
isna = is.na(training)*1
trainNNA = training[colSums(isna)==0]

isnull = (trainNNA=="")*1
trainSmall = trainNNA[colSums(isnull)==0]
```

I have used random forest for fitting the data. In order to save time, I trained the model on a half of the available samples 

```
train = sample(1:dim(trainSmall)[1],size=dim(trainSmall)[1]/2,replace=F)
trainSA = trainSmall[train,]
testSA = trainSmall[-train,]

set.seed(13234)

modelFit <- train(trainSA$classe ~ .,method="rpart",data=trainSA,na.action=na.omit)

print(modelFit$finalModel)
```

The model was good as it is seen from the confusion matrix for the test set `testSA`:

```
predTest = predict(modelFit, testSA)
confusionMatrix(testSA$classe,predTest)

> confusionMatrix(testSA$classe,predTest)

Before applying the model to other data, they must be preprocessed in the same way. For solving the assignment

```
testNNA = testing[colSums(isna)==0]
testSmall = testNNA[colSums(isnull)==0]
predTestSmall = predict(modelFit, testSmall)
print(predTestSmall)
```
Obtained output:

```
 [1] B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B
Levels: A B C D E
```
